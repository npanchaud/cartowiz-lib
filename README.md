# cartowiz-lib
This is the library and documentation of the **CartoWiz** framework.
**The library itself will be available soon.**
The framework offers a fundamental model to formalize cartographic functions into leverageable cartographic functions
for online map mashups in geoportals or similar mapping platforms.

Disclaimer: the functions have been coded to be easily readable by human and thus are not necessarily optimally written in regard to speed and length.

Several functions are already included in the framework.

Implementation examples can be found on the [project website showcase](https://npanchaud.github.io/cartowiz/60_video.html)
